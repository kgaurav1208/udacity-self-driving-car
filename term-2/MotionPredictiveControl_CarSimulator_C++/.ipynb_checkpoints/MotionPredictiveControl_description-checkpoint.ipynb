    "#### Regularization term ($\\lambda$)\n",
    "To prevent the car from wobbling, it is particularly important to emphasize the cost associated with steering transition, $C_{diff_{\\delta}}$. However, it is also important not to over-emphasize this cost component, so that the large steering transitions remain possible at sharp turns. \n",

    "Suppose that the reference trajectory is given by the simulator for a distance, $d$, which can be small near turns and large along straight paths. Assuming an average speed of around $v_{ref}$, this imposes a natural upper limit on $T$ of around $\\frac{d}{v_{ref}}$. This upper limit in the current project is manually estimated to be around $1.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, it is important that $T$ is large enough so that the current actuator inputs are sufficiently forward-looking to anticipate the future curvature of the road. A reasonable lower limit here would be $0.5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $N$ and $dt$ could be tuned for this range of $T$. A smaller $dt$ means more frequent actuations, and therefore more flexibility to approximate the reference trajectory with desirable speed and actuator attributes. However, a smaller $dt$ forces $N$ to be large in order to maintain $T$  within a reasonable range, thus increasing the computational cost, and hence, latency in a real-world scenario. In the current project, a range of values work fine: \n",
    "$dt$ between $0.05$ and $0.15$, $N$ between $6$ and $24$, subject to $T$ between $0.8$ and $1.2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Latency\n",
    "A straigtforward way to deal with a latency of $0.1$ is to estimate the state post latency from the current state and the current actuators using the kinematic model described earlier. This estimated state post latency is then taken to be the initial state from where all further processing is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing\n",
    "After estimating the car's state post latency, the coordinate frame is then shifted to that of the car in this state. In particular, this implies that the post latency $(px, py, \\psi)$ is $(0, 0, 0)$ in the new coordinate system. The waypoints for the reference trajectory given by the simulator are also transformed to the new coordinate system, and the reference trajectory is approximated by a 3rd degree polynomial. After computing $cte$ and $e\\psi$, a vector consisting of these two error terms and the car's state is fed to the MPC optimizer, which returns the optimal actuators for the post latency state of the car."
